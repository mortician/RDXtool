RDXTool is a programm for .RDX files, which contain all of the room data in Biohazard Code: Veronica / Resident Evil Code: Veronica X, it's very primitive right now,
but it's useful to see offsets and object counts in a file.

Update 16/FEB72024:
============================================================
